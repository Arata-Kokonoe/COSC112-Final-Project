Title of Project: Milton's Escape

Authors: Mana Harada, Andrew Han

Description: "This program is our own take on a video game combining both aspects of the platformer and roguelike genres. 
    The theme of the game revolves around Schrodinger’s Cat thought experiment, where the player plays as a cat named “Milton” trapped inside of a cardboard box.
    The player will have to traverse through randomly generated rooms while in constant danger from poisonous gas filling each room, along with enemies trying to kill them at every turn. 
    One unique aspect of this game is the ability to switch between a state of dead/alive, both having their own advantages and disadvantages. 
    As the player continues their epic adventure, they may find extra lives as a way to recover. The ultimate goal of the game is to survive by fighting enemies and reaching the next room."

Controls:
    * A to move left
    * D to move right
    * Space to jump
    * J to attack (once every 3 seconds)
    * K to transform into a dead cat, allowing you to not take any damage for 10 seconds, but also stopping you from being able to attack (15 second cooldown)

Future Updates (AKA the To-Do List):
    * add more roguelike aspects to the game (enemies, exp, upgrades/items, etc.)
    * make the player have a reason to go backwards sometimes (i.e. rooms with no doors/dead end rooms)
