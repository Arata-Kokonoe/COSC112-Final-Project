Title of Project: Milton's Escape

Authors: Mana Harada, Andrew Han

Description: "This program will be our own take on a video game combining both aspects of the platformer and roguelike genres. 
    The theme of the game will revolve around Schrodinger’s Cat thought experiment, where the player will play as a cat named “Milton” trapped inside of a cardboard box. 
    They will have to traverse through procedurally generated rooms while in constant danger from poisonous gas filling each room, along with enemies trying to kill them at every turn. 
    One unique aspect of this game is the ability to switch between a state of dead/alive, both having their own advantages and disadvantages. 
    As the player continues their epic adventure, they may find special puzzle rooms to reward them with extra lives as a way to recover. 
    At the end of their journey, the player will face their greatest enemy yet, Schrodinger (temporary) himself."

    * hitboxes are weird (sometimes get stuck/phase through platform)

    * linked list of rooms to allow player to move back and forth through rooms
    * more rooms
